## 👋 About Me

I am a Master's student in Data Science with a strong foundation in Mathematics and a deep interest in building real-world AI systems.  
I enjoy working across the entire ML lifecycle — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment and monitoring.

**Focus Areas**
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
- Generative AI & LLMs  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- Agentic AI Systems  
- MLOps & Cloud Deployment  

**Goal**  
Design AI systems that are accurate, scalable, and production-ready.
